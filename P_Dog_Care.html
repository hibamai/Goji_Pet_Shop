        <h1><u>How to Take Care of your Dog Properly?</u></h1>
        <h6> Please note that the following information is taken from the wikiHow Website. The original article can be found at the end of this page.</h6>
            
            <h2>1. Meeting Your Dog's Basic Needs</h2>
            <p>
                Purchase a brand of food with high-quality ingredients. You could also make your own dog food. Don't feed your dog too much sugar, fried food, or other treats for people. These will harm your dog's health over time. NEVER feed a dog chocolate, grapes, raisins, onions, garlic, or products containing xylitol (used in many sugar-free products).<br><br>
                
                Generally, large breed dogs should be fed a large-breed puppy formula until they are around one year of age. They then should be transitioned to an adult diet until changing to a senior diet at around six years of age. Small and medium breeds should be fed puppy formula until around one year of age when they should be changed to an adult diet.<br><br>
                
                If a young dog becomes overweight it is fine to switch them to adult food (which is less calorific) before they are 12 months old.
            </p>
            
            <h2>2. Feed your dog on a regular schedule.</h2>
            <p>
                Different dogs have different needs when it comes to food. If your dog is under one year old, he or she may need several meals a day. This can be reduced to twice a day for most dogs when they are around six months old. It is normal for some dogs as they get older and usually less active, to only want to eat once a day.<br><br>
                
                Try to feed your dog at the same times every day. This helps your dog to know when mealtime is and helps you to know how much your dog is eating. This can be important if you are trying to housebreak a dog, if a decrease in appetite occurs, and also in preventing obesity.
            </p>
            
            <h2>3. Monitor your dog's appetite and eating habits.</h2>
            <p>
                The appropriate amount of food should be measured out to allow you to gauge how much your dog is eating. Allow your dog to eat for about 10 â€“ 15 minutes and then the bowl should be picked up until the next feeding time. If they don't eat all of the food at this time they will be hungrier and more likely to finish it at their next feeding.<br><br>
                
                A good way to tell if your dog is getting enough or too much food is to monitor their weight and appearance. While for some more active breeds with certain body types, seeing their ribs can be normal, for most dogs that is a sign that they are not getting enough to eat. Also, if you can't feel their ribs then they may be getting too much to eat. Always check with your veterinarian if there is a question about what your dog should weigh or look like.<br><br>
                
                Free feeding, which is having food always available, can be an easy way to feed; however, it is discouraged. The good eater is liable to gain weight, and the fussy eater doesn't get the excitement of mealtimes. Try to stick to feeding your dog on a regular schedule.<br><br>
                
                Puppies that are becoming overweight may need adjustments to their feeding amounts and exercise routines. It is best to consult with your veterinarian before making any changes.<br><br>
                
                Dogs should be switched to a senior diet at around eight years of age. This helps to prevent excessive calorie intake and weight gain that can occur in an older, less active dog. It is essential to always have fresh water available at all times.
            </p>
            
            <h2>4. Provide water at all times.</h2>
            <p>
                Keeping your dog's water bowl full of freshwater is essential. Dogs need to be able to drink when they're thirsty, and there's no harm in them drinking as much water as they want. You can put a few ice cubes in the water to keep it nice and cold when it's hot outside.
            </p>
            
            <h2>5. Make sure your dog gets plenty of exercises.</h2>
            <p>
                Dogs need to be able to run around and play to stay healthy and happy. In general, take your dog for at least one, 30 minutes, walk a day, although this may not be near enough activity for a high energy dog.<br><br>
                
                Simply taking your dog outside to relieve itself isn't enough exercise. Make sure the dog gets tired out a bit every single day. <br><br>
                
                The amount of exercise your dog needs will depend on their age, breed, health, and overall level of energy. Younger, very energetic breeds will require much more exercise than older, less active ones. Keep in mind that some breeds are not suited to as much exercise as others.<br><br>
                
                If you can, find a place where it's legal to remove the leash and let him run around and stretch. <br><br>
                
                To avoid damaging developing bones and joints in puppies, it is generally recommended to not take them running or do other repetitive high impact types of exercises, such as jumping from high places. As always ask your veterinarian for exercise recommendations.<br><br>

                Interacting with your dog by playing a variety of games will keep your dog stimulated both physically and mentally while also helping to build a strong bond between the two of you.<br><br>

                Also depending on your dog's activity level and your schedule, doggie daycare can be a great way to give your dog the exercise they need while allowing them to interact with other dogs and people.<br><br>

                Insufficient exercise can lead to boredom, which can cause many behavior issues including destructive ones. It can also lead to obesity, which can cause many related health issues and should be avoided at all costs.<br><br>

                As well as exercise, mental stimulation is vital for a healthy dog. Consider playing games daily, training, and using puzzle feeders, as ways of preventing boredom.<br><br>
